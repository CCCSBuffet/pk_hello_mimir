# Hello Mimir

This is a warm-up for your first time experience with Mimir.

## Overview

The file you are looking at is called README.md. The `md` refers to *Mark Down*. Mark Down is
a concise way to do simple formatting.

If you navigate to the assignment's folder on the left, you should see the README.md and also a file called `main.cpp`.

That file is where the code for this assignment is found. Click on it. A tab in the IDE should open with the contents of the file shown.

When the instructor creates a project, they select the name of the main code file you must use. This is a weakness of Mimir so we'll have to live with it. To help you enter code into the right file name, you will most often be supplied a starter file (in this case, the `main.cpp` file).

## Compiling

There should also be a terminal open. To build this program enter:

`g++ main.cpp`

This will produce a file called `a.out`. You can verify this by typing `ls` into the terminal. One of the files listed should be `a.out`. This command will work for this project but more sophisticated commands will be needed later in the term.

## Testing

Assuming your `a.out` has been built, you can run it by typing:

`./a.out`

The `./` is necessary.

## Handing in (submitting)

When you are ready to test your program against the instructor supplied test cases, hit the SUBMIT button. You'll be asked to specify what to submit - this request is extremely confusing! Carefully locate exactly the file you wish to submit. You can also submit a folder, we'll look at this later in the term.

## Checking results of provided tests

After submitting, a dialog asks you if you want to view the submission. This is where you'll see if you passed all the tests the instructor has permitted you to see.

## The tests you see may not be all the tests

Tests can be set visible or private. Your instructor may keep some tests private on purpose. For this reason, you should really think about how to exhaustively test your work on your own and not rely upon passing only the tests that are visible.
